Both K-means and BNG seem to be able to classify the checkerboard dataset to some extent. However, ﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿﻿Batch Neural Gas seems to vastly outclass K-means, even for low epoch counts. In general terms, K-means clustering seems to be a lot faster than Batch Neural Gas, although Batch Neural Gas has better performance given enough time (epochs).  Additionally, K-means is more dependent on initial prototype locations than BNG is; i.e., BNG is more robust with regards to the initialization.
